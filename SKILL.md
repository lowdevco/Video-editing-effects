name: effects
description: Apply any of 51 video effects to a talking-head clip, including orbit, spotlight, glass widgets, timeline, checklist, headline wall, comment box, phone fan, liquid glass graph, match-cut, iPhone toggles, LED sign, over-the-shoulder zoom, iMessage pop-ups, place-in-grid, and more. Effects follow the speaker's face and can appear behind their head. Use when the user enters /effects, names an effect, or requests an effect, zoom, grade, sticker, or animation for a video.

# Effects: 51 starter effects for video (by @samknows.ai)

Users are generally nontechnical. Keep responses brief and friendly, handle the work for them, and don't ask them to run commands.

Paths below are relative to this skill's directory (where this SKILL.md lives). Use the absolute path when running commands.

## 1. Initial setup (one time)
Run `bash scripts/setup.sh`. When setup finishes, it prints `READY` (the first run takes 1–3 minutes).
- `NEED_FFMPEG`: install it for them. On a Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` (if `brew` is missing, tell them to install Homebrew from brew.sh first). On Windows: `winget install ffmpeg`.
- `NEED_PYTHON`: install Python 3.12 (Mac: `brew install python@3.12`, Windows: `winget install Python.Python.3.12`), then run setup again.
- On Windows, the Python is at `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` instead of `.venv/bin/python`.

## 2. Choose a video and effect
- Video: the user can drop a file into the chat or provide its path. Vertical phone footage is ideal.
- Effect: use `/effects <name>` or infer it from the user's description. Match their wording to the table below. If unclear, show them the list.

## 3. Set the timing
- If the user specifies "on the word X" or "when I say ...", run `.venv/bin/python scripts/words.py <video>` and use the returned timestamps.
- If no timing is provided, use the whole clip or ask which section they mean (one brief question).
- Effects usually work best in short spans of 1.5–4 seconds.

## 4. Prepare, review, and render
1. Write the plan next to their video as `<video-name>_effects.json`:
   ```json
   {"effects": [
     {"fx": "orbit", "start": 3.2, "end": 6.0},
     {"fx": "backdrop-word", "start": 14.0, "end": 16.3, "text": "CLAUDE"}
   ]}
   ```
2. Quickly preview frames first: `.venv/bin/python scripts/fx.py --plan <plan.json> <video> <folder>/check.png --still 4.5,15.2`, choosing a midpoint for each effect. Inspect the PNGs. Adjust the wording, timing, or options if anything is wrong (over the face, clipped at an edge, or hard to read).
3. Render: `.venv/bin/python scripts/fx.py --plan <plan.json> <video> <video-name>_effects.mp4`. The output keeps their original audio. It renders at 1080p by default; add `--width 2160` for 4K (slower).
4. Share the output file's location. In one line, remind the user to watch it before posting: this is a draft for their approval.

A single effect needs no plan: `.venv/bin/python scripts/fx.py orbit <video> <out.mp4> --start 3 --end 6 --text "..." --opt key=value`.

| 51 | `fan-build` | Your reel covers deal into a fan behind your head, one card at a time | `images` (folder of your covers), `count` (default 13) |

**Named looks** (same effect, a fancier look; they don't add to the count):
- `glitter-spotlight` = `spotlight` with `look=sparkle`: the room goes dark, golden rays burst from behind your head, a big gold word with a shine sweep, twinkling sparkles and a glow around you. `text` (the word), `color`, `push`.
- `cover-star` with `look=editorial`: a soft warm film look, a classic serif masthead behind your head, an issue line and elegant cover lines. `text` (masthead), `issue`, `lines` (3 lines with `\|`), `right` (lines with `\|`), `color`, `accent`, `lines_y`, `right_y`.
- `liquid-glass-graph` with `look=bento`: the climbing graph moves to a smoked glass screen behind your head, with glass bento tiles in front of you (a donut, a KPI, bars). `text`, `from`, `to`, `donut` (`29%::label`), `kpi` (`672K::label`), `bars` (`197\|140\|124::label`).
- `apple-toggles` now sits above you, tucked behind your head, with a gentle zoom (`pos=below` for the old under-the-chin card; `overlap`, `zoom`).

Aliases work too: `bill`, `to-do`, `follow`, `stamp`, `countdown`, `cover`, `rain`, `pause`.

## Guidelines
- Keep the face unobstructed. Effects either sit behind the person or avoid the face; if a preview shows text across the face, reposition it (`x`, `y`) or make it shorter.
- Effects are applied in the listed order. When combined with other effects, place camera effects (`locked-on`, `lean-in`, `spotlight`) first.
- Do not exceed 2x zoom, to preserve image sharpness.
- This skill only adds visuals. The user can add sound effects and captions separately (CapCut is a suitable option).
- These are starter effects. If the user compares them to a reel they've seen, be clear about their starter-level nature.
